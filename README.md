## Contributing

Required dependencies

- yarn >= 1.22
- Node.js >= 18.19.1


To get started with contributing to this project, simply clone the repo, ensure the above dependencies are met and run...

```

## Storybook Documentation & Testing

To use Storybook simply use the following command from the root directory of this repository

```
yarn run sb
```

The Storybook instance will provide a complete Angular environment allowing the ability to test and preview the library components independently before using them in external projects. There is also documentation and a complete design system that includes code snippets and other useful information.

Using an Angular Library allows new components to be developed in isolation forcing them to be decoupled from any business logic. Storybook can then be used in the development process to provide clear guidelines and testing to ensure those guidelines are followed.
